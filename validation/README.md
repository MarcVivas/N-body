# Validation

## Previous requirements
### Compile C++ validation code
You will first have to compile `RunAllTests.cpp` if you want to run the validation script.

The process of compiling the validation program and the requirements are the same as the main program.

#### Linux

While being in `./validation` create a new directory called build and change your location to it.
```bash
mkdir build 
cd build
```
Build a `Makefile` using `CMake`:
```bash
cmake ..
```

Compile the program using `Makefile`:
```bash
make 
```

#### Windows
These commands will create a new directory titled `build` and change the location to it.
```bash
mkdir build 
cd build
``` 
Build a `Makefile` using `cmake`.
```bash
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
```
Compile the program using the created `Makefile`.
```bash
 mingw32-make
```


### Python requirements
In order to run `benchmark.py` you will have to install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the validation
Change your location to `./validation`. 
You can run the validation with the next command:
```bash
python3 validation.py /path/to/compiled/program 
```
> Do not touch anything until the script shows you the first plot.  

> Please note that there are multiple plots generated by the script, but only one plot will appear at a time. You will need to close the current plot to see the next one.
